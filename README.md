## Overview

Project for Intelligent Systems Engineering course a.y. 2023-2024.

*Agent Seek* is a simple game where the player moves in a 2D environment, seeking the exit that
leads to the next level. The player needs to avoid the agents that are trying to catch him.

<p align="center"><img width=30% src="resources/gifs/basic_structure.gif"></p>

The game features three types of agents, each with distinct behaviors:
1. **Camera Agent** (_Gray_)
   - Stationary but rotates to detect the player in its field of view.
   - Alerts all other agents if it spots the player.
2. **Hearing Agent** (_Red_)
   - Moves through the environment, guided solely by sound.
   - Chases noise sources created by the player.
3. **Guard Agent** (_Blue_)
   - Actively patrols and can see and hear the player.
   - Upon detecting the player, it:
     - Starts chasing immediately.
     - Alerts nearby guards to protect the exit.
     - Responds to alerts from the Camera Agent.

Player Controls:
- _Movement_: Use W, A, S, D to move.
- _Sneak_: Hold SHIFT to move slower and more silently.
- _Distraction_: Click near your position (within a short range) to create noise and lure agents away from your path.
